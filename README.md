### Project Requirements
    *  Build the application using React and Redux
    *  Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
    *  Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work
    *  Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
        *  Wireframes
        *  Technologies used
        *  Features
        *  Future work
    *  Write unit tests for your components using Jest and Enzyme
    *  Write end-to-end tests for your application
    *  Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)
    *  Users can use the application on any modern browser
    *  Users can access your application at a URL
    *  Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app
    *  Users can search the data using terms
    *  Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined
    *  Users are shown a detail view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item
    *  Users are delighted with a cohesive design system
    *  Users are delighted with animations and transitions
    *  Users are able to leave an error state
    *  Get 90+ scores on Lighthouse
        *  We understand you cannot control how media assets like videos and images are sent to the client. It is okay to have a score below 90 for Performance if they are related to the media from Reddit.
    *  OPTIONAL: Get a custom domain name and use it for your application
    *  OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes
    *  OPTIONAL: Make your application a progressive web app
